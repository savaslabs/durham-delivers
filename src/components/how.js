        Durham Delivers was created out of the need to help local restaurants
        whose dining rooms were shuttered due to COVID-19, get their food to
        customers. By grouping orders at one location and time, while
        eliminating hefty service fees levied by popular delivery apps, Durham
        Delivers provides a financially viable option for independent
        restaurants, while adding new delivery options for customers.
